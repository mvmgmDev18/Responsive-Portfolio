      <p>Hello! My name is Michael, and this is my Responsive-Portfolio webpage. I am currently attending the University of Arizona Coding
        Bootcamp to become a full-stack developer. I have a background in Desktop Engineering, desktop support, vlan port
        administration using Cisco switches, supporting from 500 to 3000 users.</p>

      <p>So far, this class has been very grueling. Many late nights afterwork of coding. Coding is very new to me since only
        having one class in college for C++ and Visual Basic.</p>

      <p>Overall, despite the difficulty I am really having, I'm also enjoying the challenge! Thanks for stopping by!</p>
